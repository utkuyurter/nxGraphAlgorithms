# nxGraphAlgorithms


*This is a project for the Discrete Math class where we are creating useful functions for the Graph Theory and related problems.*


- **test.py** > The main file where I test if the functions are working properly by manipulating input and checking the output.
- **fucntions.py** > The file with the functions that return a list, set, or vertice.
- **booleanChecks.py** > The file with boolean functions.
